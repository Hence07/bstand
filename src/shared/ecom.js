Seal of Hope with its partners are intending to train youth in various regions in best techniques and crops growing, to supply seeds and build water facilities to help establish off season crops growing. We are going to support African Agriculture in the transformation of the production into finite or semi-finite products with the objective of adding value, supporting jobs growth in rural areas and maintaining young people in Africa for better productivity. This last aspect of our Agriculture project will help stop or reduce the high risk sea migration phenomenon. "
